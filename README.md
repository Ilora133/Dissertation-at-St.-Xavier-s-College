My dissertation examined the relationship between neurodegenerative diseases and nanotechnology. This project was part of a literature review that hints on how selenoprotein possesses antioxidant properties and its deficiency has been associated with the disease. So, rare earth nanoparticles, such as selenium nanoparticles, comes into the picture, speculated to have the potential to reduce ROS species generation and thereby reducing neurodegeneration at a particular concentration and at zero oxidation state.  This project ignited my interest in nanoscience and the therapeutic potential of nanoparticles in treating rare genetic disorders.
